                    content: `To apply to become a permanent resident or citizen of the UK, you will need to:
- speak and read English
- have a good understanding of life in the UK.

There are currently two ways you can be tested on these requirements:

1. Take the Life in the UK test. The questions are written in a way that requires an understanding of the English language at English for Speakers of Other Languages (ESOL) Entry Level 3, so there is no need to take a separate English language test. People here on work visas, including those on Tier 1 and Tier 2 of the points based system, normally must pass the Life in the UK test to become permanent residents.

2. Pass an ESOL course in English with Citizenship. You will need to take this course if your standard of English is below ESOL Entry Level 3. The course will help you to improve your English and learn more about life in the UK. At the end of the course you will take a test.

Once you have passed one of these tests, you can make an application for permanent residence or British citizenship. The form that you have to complete and the evidence that you need to provide will depend on your personal circumstances. There is a fee for submitting an application, which is different for the various types of application. All of the forms and a list of fees can be found on the UK Border Agency website, www.ukba.homeoffice.gov.uk.

From October 2013, for settlement or permanent residence, you will need to:
- Pass the Life in the UK test
- Produce acceptable evidence of speaking and listening skills in English at B1 of the Common European Framework of Reference. This is equivalent to ESOL Entry Level 3.

The requirements for citizenship applications may also change in the future. Further details will be published on the UK Border Agency website and you should check the information on that website for current requirements before applying for settlement or citizenship.`

As part of the citizenship ceremony, new citizens pledge to uphold these values. The pledge is:
'I will give my loyalty to the United Kingdom and respect its rights and freedoms. I will uphold its democratic values. I will observe its laws faithfully and fulfil my duties and obligations as a British citizen.'

Following from the fundamental principles are responsibilities and freedoms which are shared by all those living in the UK and which we expect all residents to respect.

- respect and obey the law

                    content: `British democracy has developed over many centuries, evolving from absolute monarchy to parliamentary democracy.

Key developments in British democracy:

- Magna Carta (1215): Limited the power of the king and established the principle that everyone, including the king, was subject to the law
- The English Civil War (1640s): Established that Parliament had authority over the king
- The Glorious Revolution (1688): Established Parliament's supremacy
- The Reform Acts (1832, 1867, 1884): Gradually extended voting rights to more men
- Women's suffrage (1918, 1928): Gave women the right to vote
- Representation of the People Acts: Further extended voting rights and made the system more democratic

Today, the UK has a fully democratic system where all adults over 18 have the right to vote in elections. The government is elected by the people and must answer to Parliament.

The UK uses a "first-past-the-post" voting system for general elections, where the candidate with the most votes in each constituency wins.`

Unlike many countries, the UK does not have a single written constitution. Instead, the constitution is made up of:

1. Statutes (Acts of Parliament): Laws passed by Parliament that have constitutional significance, such as:
   - Magna Carta (1215)
   - Bill of Rights (1689)
   - Act of Settlement (1701)
   - Parliament Acts (1911, 1949)
   - European Communities Act (1972)
   - Human Rights Act (1998)
   - Constitutional Reform Act (2005)

2. Common law: Legal principles developed by judges through court decisions over centuries

3. Conventions: Unwritten rules and practices that are generally followed, such as:
   - The Prime Minister must be a member of the House of Commons
   - The monarch acts on the advice of ministers
   - Ministers are responsible to Parliament

4. Works of authority: Writings by constitutional experts that explain how the system works

5. European Union law (until Brexit): EU treaties and regulations that were part of UK law

This flexible system allows the constitution to evolve over time without needing a formal amendment process.`
